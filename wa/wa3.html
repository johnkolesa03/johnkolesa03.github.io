    <p>The <strong>chair</strong> has been used since antiquity, although for many centuries it was a 
    symbolic article of state and dignity rather than an article for ordinary use. "The chair" is 
    still used as the emblem of authority in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom[6] and 
    Canada,[7] and in many other settings. In keeping with this historical connotation of the 
    "chair" as the symbol of authority, committees, boards of directors, and academic departments
    all have a 'chairman' or 'chair'.[8] Endowed professorships are referred to as chairs.[9] 
    It was not until the 16th century that chairs became common.[10] Until then, people sat on 
    chests, benches, and stools, which were the ordinary seats of everyday life. The number of 
    chairs which have survived from an earlier date is exceedingly limited; most examples are of 
    ecclesiastical, seigneurial or feudal origin.</p>

    <p>Chairs were in existence since at least the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt (c. 3100 BC). They 
    were covered with cloth or leather, were made of carved wood, and were much lower than today's 
    chairs â€“ chair seats were sometimes only 10 inches (25 cm) high.[11] In ancient Egypt, chairs appear 
    to have been of great richness and splendor. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded 
    wood, they were covered with costly materials, magnificent patterns and supported upon representations 
    of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives. Generally speaking, the higher ranked an individual 
    was, the taller and more sumptuous was the chair he sat on and the greater the honor. On state occasions, 
    the pharaoh sat on a throne, often with a little footstool in front of it.</p>

    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <p>Chairs can be made from wood, metal, or other strong materials, like stone or acrylic. In some cases, 
    multiple materials are used to construct a chair; for example, the legs and frame may be made from metal 
    and the seat and back may be made from plastic. Chairs may have hard surfaces of wood, metal, plastic, 
    or other materials, or some or all of these hard surfaces may be covered with upholstery or padding. 
    The design may be made of porous materials, or be drilled with holes for decoration; a low back or gaps 
    can provide ventilation. The back may extend above the height of the occupant's head, which can optionally 
    contain a headrest. Chairs can also be made from more creative materials, such as recycled materials like 
    cutlery and wooden play bricks, pencils, plumbing tubes, rope, corrugated cardboard, and PVC pipe. Specialty
    chairs have also been made from wood colected from the <a href="https://jrinz.github.io/wa/wa3.html#preditoryanimals">Amazon Rainforest</a></p>

    <h2>Accessories</h2> 
    <p>In place of a built-in footrest, some chairs come with a matching ottoman. An ottoman is a short stool that is intended to be used as a footrest but can sometimes be used as a stool. If matched to a glider chair, the ottoman may be mounted on swing arms so that the ottoman rocks back and forth with the main glider.
        A chair cover is a temporary fabric cover for a side chair. They are typically rented for formal events such as wedding receptions to increase the attractiveness of the chairs and decor. The chair covers may come with decorative chair ties, a ribbon to be tied as a bow behind the chair. Covers for sofas and couches are also available for homes with small children and pets. In the second half of the 20th century, some people used custom clear plastic covers for expensive sofas and chairs to protect them.
        Chair pads are cushions for chairs. They contain cotton or foam for padding. Some are decorative. In cars, they may be used to increase the height of the driver. Orthopedic back-rests provide support for the back. Car seats sometimes have built-in and adjustable lumbar supports. These can also be used on kitchen chairs.
        Chair mats are mats meant to cover different types of flooring. They are usually made from plastic. This allows chairs on wheels to roll easily over the carpet and protects the carpet or floor. They come in various shapes, some specifically sized to fit partially under a desk.
        Remote control bags can be draped over the arm of easy chairs or sofas and used to hold remote controls for home cinemas. They are counter-weighted so as to not slide off the arms under the weight of the remote controls. 
        Chair glides are attached to the feet of chairs to prevent them from scratching or snagging on the floor.</p>
